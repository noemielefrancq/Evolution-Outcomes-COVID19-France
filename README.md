**Evolution of outcomes for patients hospitalised during the first 9 months of the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic in France: A retrospective national surveillance data analysis**, Noémie Lefrancq, Juliette Paireau, Nathanaël Hozé, Noémie Courtejoie, Yazdan Yazdanpanah, Lila Bouadma, Pierre-Yves Boëlle, Fanny Chereau, Henrik Salje, Simon Cauchemez, _The Lancet Regional Health - Europe_, Volume 5, 2021 (https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2666776221000648#fig0005)

Our framework is able to monitor in-hospital mortality in real-time, accounting for delays and censoring. It can be used to:
- 1 - assess changes in patient outcomes over the course of an epidemic
- 2 - estimate (in real-time) detailed age- and sex- specific estimates of those outcomes

### Codes
- Stan code: XXX.stan
- R code to run the Stan code and estimate the parameters: XXX.R

### Data
- Example of a dataset needed to run the model: XXX.R
